I study <b>public policy and the management of government administration</b> </br> 
to explore questions that matter in people’s lives: </br> 
</br>
1. <b>How can we harness technological innovation </b>  to turn public support into real, measurable </br> improvements for communities? </br>
2. <b>How can we remove psychological and bureaucratic barriers</b> that prevent individuals in need from </br> accessing the public services?   </br>
3. <b>How can we support those who are trying to rebuild their lives</b>—especially economically </br> disadvantaged individuals—so they don’t lose hope after setbacks? </br>
4. <b>How can we create work environments for public workforces </b> that sustain motivation and purpose, </br> without frustration, while still pushing toward meaningful policy outcomes?
