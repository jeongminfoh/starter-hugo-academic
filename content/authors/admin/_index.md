Public Service: Discharged upon completion in the Republic of Korea Army as a first lieutenant
Curious: very interested in what my peers are studying, and how that research might influence my own ideas or projects
Initiative: developing my own ideas and find how to seek partners who have complimentary skill sets 

I'm interested in evidence-based policy, citizen-centric public service delivery, public management with a focus on organizational theory and strategic management to support tangible improvements to people’s lives into the real world for the construction of livable communities. 
Using behavioral, data, and design sciences, I study how innovation in policy design and technology improves under-resourced communities’ access to public services to become economically self-sufficient. I found that public services are not successfully delivered to under-resourced communities even if policymakers introduce a sophisticated public policy. With my lifelong fascination in technology innovation, I am investigating cognitive and administrative barriers that prevent the eligible from accessing the services.
