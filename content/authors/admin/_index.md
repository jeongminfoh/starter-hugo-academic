I study Public Policy & Public Service Delivery </br> 
to find answers to the following questions:</br> 
</br>
How can we translate support for tangible improvements to people's lives into real-world action? </br>
How can we remove psychological and administrative barriers for economically disadvantaged individuals to access public services?   
In order to enhance the public service user experience and achieve policy success, how can we improve employee satisfaction and commitment in government agencies ?
