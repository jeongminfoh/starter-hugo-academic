I'm a Ph.D. candidate in public adminisration at Florida State University. </br> 
I'm interested in Designing public services with a focus on equitable access, </br>
psychological & administrative burden, and causal inference of data-driven </br>
policy interventions by using behavioral, data, and design sciences </br> 
to support tangible improvements to people’s lives into the real world.  </br>

- Public Service: former first lieutenant in the Republic of Korea Army | ROTC (Reserve Officers’ Training Corps)
- Curious: very interested in what my peers are studying, and how that research might influence my own ideas or projects
- Initiative: developing my own ideas and find how to seek partners who have complimentary skill sets
